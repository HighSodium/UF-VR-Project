# "Face Your Fears" by Good Intentions
University of Florida Virtual Reality Project
for CIS4930: Introduction to Virtual Reality over Summer 2024

## Introduction
This is a project focused on exploring experiencing different phobias.
Our idea is to give the player the chance to experience a simulated version of a few select common phobias.

### Those in our selection include:
1. Acrophobia - Fear of Heights
2. Arachnophobia - Fear of Spiders
3. Thalassophobia - Fear of Large Bodies of Water

## Our Goal
Our goal is to allow the player the option to experience a virtual version of their fears, which may give a safe, simplified version that can be handled.
This is exemplified through our use of Virtual Reality, which can give the user a much more "real" sensation than just being a 3D game.
There is not a focus on photorealism, as that may become too difficult for the person playing, as well as closing doors on accessibility to those with less powerful hardware.

## How to Access It Locally
1. ```git clone``` this repository
2. Ensure you are using Unity Editor version ```2022.3.30f1```
